        <h3>Context</h2>
        <p>I'm looking for a career change, so I'm following the Epicodus boot
          camp online.  As I go I'll learn new
          techniques and approaches. </p>
        <p>I have just learnt about prototypes and constructors and can see an opportunity to
          refactor the Racecar game and reduce the line count significantly.</p>
        <p>This project is to refactor the car selector page, the track itself will be a later
          project.    
        </p>  
        <p>The motivation for doing so remains the same:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gives me practice and reinforces what I've learned</li>
          <li>Forces me to extend beyond the course material</li>
          <li>Demonstrates that I am can make a useful contribution to a team
        </ul>

        <h3>Racecar Game</h3>
        <p>While the game itself was an interesting project, I also wanted to build
           something that I could use for future refactoring projects based on what
            I will learn later in the course.

          At the point this refactoring project was started I had learned about HTML and Bootstrap,
           and gone some way Javascript.  The subjects left to study are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Test Driven Development and Environments with JavaScript</li>
          <li>Asynchrony and APIs</li>
        </ul>   
        
        <h3>Product Backlog</h3>
        <p> Last updated 4th September 2020</p>
        <p>Product owner's priority is demonstrating capability to code, not to produce a perfect game</p>  

        <ul>
          <li>Refactor all functions and ensure variables are appropriately glocal or local / 8 story point   Started</li>
          <li style="padding-left: 18px;"><span style="padding-left: 18px;">Refactor functions in car selector / 3 story points</span></li>
          <li><del>Make the card flip work through the shuffled stack of cards, rather than each card is random / 5 story point </del> Done </li>
          <li><del>Change BigWheelCorvette to a model that is longer than it is wide / 1 story point</del> Done</li>
          <li>Shuffle icons on track / 8 story points</li>
          <li>Capture track shape as a vector, build track as a data, then turn data into HTML / 144 story points</li>
          <li><span>Remove "Are you ready" alert that stops cardflip from 
            malfunctioning / </span><del>55</del>   8 story point</span></li>
          <li>Correct size of yellow racecar card / 1 story point</li>
          <li>Give players a choice of how many laps the race will last and alert the winner / 2story points</li>
          <li>Remove alert asking player if they have missed an earlier racecar / 0.5 story points</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Grid</h3>
        I wanted to build in the flexibility to place icons in different places in 
        future versions. At that point I didn't have the tool to properly isolate 
        the icon, so each icon had a black or grey edge of colour that would blend 
        with the background colour, as long as the icon was placed in exactly the right place. 
        If I do a project to randomly place icons on the track I will address the isolation of 
        the image icons then.<br>
 
        I quickly found out that Bootstrap grid is fine for big blocks, but hopeless 
        for the level detail needed to turn a photograph of a floor mat into an onscreen 
        map. I found the grid tools, and built a system of a 20x20 grid that roughly 
        aligned to the playing squares. Within each grid, a subsidiary 3x3 grid was 
        built to allow exact placing of the icon. This then had to become a 4x4 grid 
        to allow placing of the cars. Then I discovered div contexts really matter 
        when trying to use z index to put cars on top of icons and then hiding them 
        behind icons.  The final solution of a very fine grid based on viewwidths 
        scales ended up providing a single div context and enough flexibility to 
        place every icon and car in the right place.
       
        <h3>Arrays and looping</h3>
        Part of the challenge was to build the game not using arrays (which I knew 
        about from Python but hadn't learned in Javascript).  I expect to learn 
        more powerful database tools than simple arrays. In the original game 
        successive cards are turned over from a stack of cards which is probably 
        almost ideal looping through a simple array. But initially each card 
        turn was a fresh 1 in 32 chance. The first refactoring project: "Racecar Stack
        of Card Refactor" addressed this so successive card turns worked through the array of cards.

        <h3>Global and local variables</h3>
        This was touched on briefly in the course but was not properly applied when
        the game was made. Refactoring projects will address this issue.

        <h3>Graphic design and game play</h3>
        I have no pretention to be a graphic designer.  I love good visual 
        design but I have no skill in identifying what makes for good design, nor 
        have I invested time to learn graphic design tools. I found online 
        isolation tools in time to isolate the vehicles but not the icons. It 
        is doubtful I will bother refactoring the graphic design although it 
        clearly could do with some.
        
        <h3> Event Bubbling</h3>
        Event bubbling prevents the card flip from working unless there is a break.  The "Are you 
        ready" alert provides this break. In a similar way, there is a problem 
        with removing the vehicle when both cars are on the same spot, and this 
        is fixed by always removing the class from the shared spot positions, 
        irrespective of the number of cars on the spot.  These fixes are pretty 
        ugly.  Having learned about event bubbling they will be addressed in a future 
        refactoring project.
          
        <h3>Known Bugs</h3> 
        The "do you want to block repeated alerts" message on the alerts is 
        probably a setting somewhere that I will find at some point.
        It isn't possible to run web developer tools until the page is properly 
        loaded due to errors in the Bootstrap library.
